#  ::: NOM256 ::: 
A Cryptographic Hash Algorithm, in Python.  
Outputs a 256-bit 64 character hash, 'hash-graph', and metadata, given a file.

## How to use
1. Set up or rename a copy of the file you want to hash as `meal.txt`. 
  - This can be any document file, or a simple text file with just a password.
  - It is recommended you create a new directory (`/hash` for example) with your `meal.txt` and `NOM256-v2.py`
2. Run NOM256-v2, in the same directory as your `meal.txt` file.
  - You can run it in the command prompt: `$ python NOM256-v2.py`
  - Once running, you'll be shown the estimated time left to complete. The hash rate is approximately 0.0425 seconds per 1,000 bytes (ASCII characters).

| Time/seconds | Size/bytes or  Total Characters |
|--------------|---------------------------------|
| 4.25e-5      | 1                               |
| 0.0425       | 1,000                           |
| 0.425        | 10,000                          |
| 4.25         | 100,000                         |
| 42.5         | 1,000,000                       |

3. The following files will be written in the same directory/folder:
  - `outhash.txt` with the hash as a single 64 character hexadecimal alphanumeric string.  
    Example: `B62F0E417874A438574C54B927B25DAFF30EB75872E3512D05F34503D8EF4742`
  - `outhash-history.txt` with the history of hashes within the directory as multiple lines of hash strings, including the last hash.
  - `outhash-test.txt`. Similar to `outhash-history.txt`, with useful metadata.
  - `outhash.png` with the hash as a unique 'hash-graph' PNG image file. Its colour will change depending on the hash too.

Hash-graphs are generated with a pseudorandom variable colour, generated by their hash, to aid in quicker dicernment between hashes at a glance.

*These hashes were generated from a 45 KB file with only a single character change.*
