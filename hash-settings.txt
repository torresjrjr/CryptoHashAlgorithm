HASH SETTINGS
-------------
You can adjust the NOM256 settings here.
NOM256 will read this file and do what you want.

Make sure that only the options after the colons 
are filled out, or it'll likely be misread by the 
program and will just perform with normal settings.
If settings are miunderstood, the program will 
create a new `hash-settings.txt` file.
